# New Relic Java Instrumentation for SAP

Instrumentation for the SAP framework.  

## Agent Configuration
Because of the way JDBC is implemented in SAP and the way that the New Relic Java Agent instruments JDBC, it is necessary to disable the agent instrumentation and use a customized set of instrumentation included with this instrumentation set.
  
 To disable, 
 1. Edit newrelic.yml
 2. Find the following stanza:
<img width="1174" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8822859/220480243-319308d3-4b4b-47d8-ad62-c18fc389dd7e.png">
  
  3. Add the following lines after the last line
  
    com.newrelic.instrumentation.jdbc-generic:
      enabled: false
  4. Save newrelic.yml
 
## JMX Collection  
To configure the Java Agent to collect SAP related JMX metrics see: https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/newrelic-java-sap-bi/blob/main/JMX-Configuration.md.   
  
## Installation

To install, follow the instruction in the release notes
   
## Getting Started

Once installed, the instrumentation will track transactions through the various SAP components.

## Logs ##
Serveral of the instrumentation modules can be used to generate logs containing SAP data.  This is done because the amount of data sent via custom events is limited.  This data can be monitored via the New Relic Logs product.   
For details on what is collected and how to configure see https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/newrelic-java-sap-bi/blob/main/Logs/Logging.md   

## Custom Events   
  
A number of custom events are generated by this instrumentation package.  For details see https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/newrelic-java-sap-bi/blob/main/CustomEvents.md.   
   
## Building

Note that because SAP is a proprietary software it is necessary for you to have access to a licensed instance of SAP.   Each component has a file named holder.txt in the lib directory that is a list of necessary jar files.   Copy those jars from your instance to the lib directory.   
   
Building the extension requires that Gradle is installed.
To build the extension jars from source, follow these steps:
### Build single extension
To build a single extension with name *extension*, do the following:
1. Set an environment variable *NEW_RELIC_EXTENSIONS_DIR* and set its value to the directory where you want the jar file built.
2. Run the command: ./gradlew *extension*:clean *extension*:install
### Build all extensions
To build all extensions, do the following:
1. Set an environment variable *NEW_RELIC_EXTENSIONS_DIR* and set its value to the directory where you want the jar file built.
2. Run the command: ./gradlew clean install
