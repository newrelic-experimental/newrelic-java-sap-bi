# SAP Message Logging Configuration #
The feature that allows for logging each message in SAP PI/PO to a log file is contained in the extension sap-audit-log.jar.   In addition it will also log audit messages to another log.
The fields that can be written to the message log file is configurable via the saploggingconfig.json.    The details on the configuration are in this document.  The configuration file needs to be placed in the New Relic Java Agent directory (the directory containing the newrelic.jar).   The configuration file is dynamic, so any changes to the file will be picked up within a minute or so without having to restart the application.
The messages that are written to the log are based on three different types, Message, QueueMessage (internal) and FinalMessageStatus.  When the message is written to the log it will write the type as Logging Type.
## Message Fields Configuration ##
The configuration for which fields to log is contained in the file saploggingconfig.json provided and needs to be placed in the New Relic Java Agent directory (this is the directory containing newrelic.jar).  This configuration is JSON and contains what appears to be all available fields related to the message written to the log.  Most are turned off (value false).  To enable a field simply change the value to true and save the configuration file.
The configuration file contains five different JSON configuration items.  Some of the configuration item names end with _all.   These represent items which can produce multiple items.  They are followed in the configuration file by the fields that it can produce.  If the _all item is set to true then the other items are ignored and all of them are reported.  To only report selected items, set the _all item to false and set the items you want to true.   For example, there are to and from for both Party and Service available for messages.  Both have both a name and a type associated with them.   If _all is set to true then both the name and the type will be written to the log.  To only write the name, set _all to false and name to true.
The five different types of configurations are: MessageStatus, ErrorCode, Message, TransportableMessage and QueueMessage.  Each of these has a JSON Object associated with it that ends with -Config.
#### Note ####
If the value of the item is not defined (null) or empty (zero length string), it will not be written to the log.
  
### MessageStatus ###
status - set to true to write message status to the log for all messages.  Default value is true
